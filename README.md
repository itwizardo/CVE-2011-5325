Title: PoC: Detecting Hardcoded Credentials (Default Password) in DCS-953L Firmware of Dlink (Novi Hogeschool Assessment)

Purpose: This Python script provides a foundational demonstration of how to automate the initial steps of searching for hardcoded credentials within a GitHub repository. It's designed as an educational Proof of Concept (PoC) for a Novi Hogeschool assessment.

How it Works

Downloads a Repository: The script downloads a specified GitHub repository as a ZIP file.
Extracts the Archive: It extracts the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.
Locates a Target File: The script navigates the extracted file structure to locate a specific file (in this example, 'etc/passwd_default').
Copies File Content: The contents of the target file are copied to a new file ('done.txt') for further manual inspection.
Important Notes

This is a simplified PoC. It does not include sophisticated pattern-matching techniques to pinpoint actual credentials. Identifying hardcoded credentials often necessitates the use of regular expressions and more advanced string analysis.
Consider this a building block for a more robust hardcoded credentials detection tool.
Usage

Ensure you have the requests and zipfile libraries installed (pip install requests zipfile).
Modify the github_url variable to point to the target repository.
Run the script: python download_and_search.py
