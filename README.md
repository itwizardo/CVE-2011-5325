Title: PoC: Detecting Hardcoded Credentials (Default Password) in DCS-953L Firmware of Dlink (Novi Hogeschool Assessment)

Purpose: This Python script provides a foundational demonstration of how to automate the initial steps of searching for hardcoded credentials within a GitHub repository. It's designed as an educational Proof of Concept (PoC) for a Novi Hogeschool assessment.

Usage: To use the provided script, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Required Modules: You need to install the `requests` module if it's not already installed. You can do this using pip, Python's package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `download_repo.py` file, and run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python3 CVE-2019-12550.py   

4. Check Output: After running the script, it will download the specified GitHub repository, extract its contents, locate the `/etc/passwd_default` file, read its content, and write it to a new file named `done.txt`. You can find the `done.txt` file in the same directory where you ran the script.

5. Review Output: Open the `done.txt` file to review the contents of the `/etc/passwd_default` file, which was retrieved.

How it Works

Downloads a Repository: The script downloads a specified GitHub repository as a ZIP file.
Extracts the Archive: It extracts the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.
Locates a Target File: The script navigates the extracted file structure to locate a specific file (in this example, 'etc/passwd_default').
Copies File Content: The contents of the target file are copied to a new file ('done.txt') for further manual inspection.
Important Notes

This is a simplified PoC. It does not include sophisticated pattern-matching techniques to pinpoint actual credentials. Identifying hardcoded credentials often necessitates the use of regular expressions and more advanced string analysis.
Consider this a building block for a more robust hardcoded credentials detection tool.
Usage

Ensure you have the requests and zipfile libraries installed (pip install requests zipfile).
Modify the github_url variable to point to the target repository.
Run the script: python download_and_search.py
