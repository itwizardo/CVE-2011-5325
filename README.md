Purpose: This Python script provides a rudimentary demonstration of how to search for files that might contain hardcoded credentials within the Dlink DCS-935L Firmware. It's a starting point for understanding the concept and could be expanded into a more sophisticated tool.

Key Points:
* Downloads a GitHub repository as a ZIP file.
* Extracts the ZIP archive.
* Locates a specific file (in this example, 'etc/password_default')
* Copies the file's contents for manual inspection.
* 
Important Notes:
* This PoC does NOT perform pattern matching to identify actual credentials. It simply extracts a potential target file.
* Real-world hardcoded credential detection requires more advanced techniques, such as regular expressions.
* Consider this a foundational example for educational purposes.
